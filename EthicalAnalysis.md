# An Ethical Analysis of Using Generative AI for Political Means

The following examines the New York Times article, "How ChatGPT Hijacks Democracy", written by Nathan E. Sanders and Bruce Schneier. The purpose of the response below is to provide reasoning on the ethical dilemma: Is it ethical to use generative AI for government lobbying or other areas of political influence, as described in the article?

Consider what utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics would suggest about the ethics of using this technology. Write each of these analyses (including explaining each framework), and then consider them as a whole and what you actually think, drawing from and combining these frameworks or making a decision entirely on your own. As part of your analyses, you may also note additional information that you would want to know in order to make better decisions.

Remember that there are no right or wrong answers. You will be graded on your understanding of and ability to explain these different ethical frameworks, and your ability to apply them to this specific situation.

As a rule of thumb, your answer will likely be around 800 words â€” 100 to explain and 100 to analyze for each ethical theory, and another 200 to synthesize and provide your own opinion. You do not need to include citations to the article above or to the class readings. However, if you consult any additional sources (which you are welcome to but do not have to do), be sure to include a list of references after your response.
